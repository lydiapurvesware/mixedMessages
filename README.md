# mixedMessages
This is a short program that generates a random 'Song Of The Day' for the user. Each time the program runs, a new random song title is generated. The song inspirations come mostly from my nephew's favorite song lists so it should be interesting but mostly it should bring a smile to your face. 
This program has been built to fulfill the Mixed Messages assignment on Codecademy.
